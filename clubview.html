          Cornell already had a designated platform for clubs- so, what was the need to create something new? We gleaned through our user research common pain points associated with CampusGroups and other user goals that the platform simply didn't address. Furthermore, CampusGroups has outdated information and is overwhelming.

        <h4>Our MVP</h4>
        <p>
          In discussion with our developers and product managers, an MVP was created to decide on what features would be prioritized for design for our initial launch to meet the basic goals of our potential users.

      <div>
        <h4>Information Hierarchy</h4>
        <p>Our team drafted an information hierarchy to combine the features we outlined as most important. We prioritized visibility of the home page which would show a large variety of different clubs to search from by making it our landing page. We also housed a majority of the features under the menu to make them intuitive and all listed in one place for ease of access.</p>

        <h3>Club Page</h3>
      </div>
      <h4>Low + Mid Fis</h4>
      <p>
        From low-fi sketches, I began to draft how a club's information could best be represented. In particular, I focused on the layout of content- which parts could utilize the most visibility to meet the user goal of users searching for clubs and recruitment information.
      </p>
      <div class="imageblock">
        <img class="iteration2" src="clubview/lowfis_cv_page.png">
      </div>
      <p>
        I wanted to create something that was visually engaging, communicative, and emphasized what features I prioritized based on the previous user research:
      </p>
      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; justify-content: center; gap:10px;">
        <div class="imageblock">
          <img class="iteration2" src="clubview/lowfi_cv.png">
        </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          <b>üö© Recruitment Banner:</b> Immediate details on the status of that club's recruitment.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>üìù Categories:</b> Tag descriptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>üñºÔ∏è Image:</b> A logo or photo that could represent the club.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>üîó Links:</b> Links to other resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>‚ù§Ô∏è Favorite Button:</b> Users can favorite a club they're interested in so that they can remember and go back to it later.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        <em>The low-fi layout chosen to iterate upon for its straightforward structuring of content which highlights elements of most importance such as name, links, and the favoriting clubs feature.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        With this criteria in mind, I chose a low-fi teration. This layout seperates between a left and right side to distribute different key components to the page. The <b>right side</b> allows users to scroll through larger pieces of content such as descriptions and images. 
        The static <b>left side</b> displays more vital information such as name, links, and other categories so that they won't move and will always be visible.
      </p>
      <div class="imageblock">
        <img class="iteration2" src="clubview/mid_fi_considerations.png">
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        <em>After establishing a general page layout through my low-fi's, I began to iterate and receive feedback upon mid-fi's for location and type of component for features</em>
      </p>

      <h4>High-Fi UI</h4>
      <p>
        There were many rounds of iterations to adjust both the visual branding and layout of the individual club page. Below are a few of the mockups that were developed during the iteration process. 
      </p>
      <div class="imageblock">
        <img class="iteration" style="width: 100%;" src="clubview/old_iterations.png">
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        <em>Mid-fi iterations on the individual club page that were adjusted to reduce visual clutter and have a more modern interface.</em>
       </p>
      <p>
        The individual clubpage went thorugh mid-fi and high-fi iterating to arrive at this final design. Important functions such as accessing links to various club resources or favoriting the club by clicking the heart were highlighted, and the design itself was centered around a pink palette as a bright color to draw attention and demonstrate the excitement of student organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        While previous iterations applied a large variety of colors used frequently, in developing the current high-fi designs I focused on applying color to emphasize specific calls-to-action to create a less visually crowded page where important features are more visible.
      </p>
      <div class="imageblock">
        <img class="iteration" style="width: 100%;" src="clubview/clubpage_final.png">
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
       <em>The finalized club pages apply the primary pink color minimally and features a gray backdrop with white cards to visually organize different information components in an easily digestible way.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The more finalized UI I settled upon made some primary changes to better fulfill the goals of the users:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>üé® Reduced color:</b> I reduced the use of the color palette to encourage user attention towards important features such as links or the recruitment banner.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
        <b>‚òØÔ∏è Improved contrast:</b> To increase visibility I introduced dropshadows and a gray background behind the white cards so that there was more contrast to emphasize pieces of content.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Displaying Events
      </h4>
      <p>
        A major pain point when students were surveyed was the lack of an easy way to see a club's recruitment schedule.
      </p>
      <div class="imageblock">
        <img class="iteration2" src="clubview/scrolled_events.png">
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        <em>Users can add an event to their Google Calendar.</em>
      </p>
      <div class="imageblock">
        <img class="iteration2" src="clubview/eventcard_iterations.png">
      </div>
      <p><b>Considerations:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Scrolling vs Details</p></li>
        <li><p>Content availability</p></li>
        <li><p>Limited attention span</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We took inspiration from platforms with similar content such as Facebook and LinkedIn, though a major feature of these platforms is that continued scrolling is encouraged. Furthermore, having one standardized card size wouldn't give certain clubs the level of <b>personalization</b> they desire. Clubview's user group would be moving quickly and might not want to scroll through multiple large cards, which helped us arrive at our solution:
      </p>
      <div class="imageblock">
        <img class="iteration2" src="clubview/seemore_click.png">
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 8%;">

        So, why change?
      </h4>
      <p>
        While the benefits of in-page editing included better visualization and a similar UI to match viewing a page, we ultimately came to the conclusion to change how club owners edit.

        <span style='font-size:20px; margin-right: 10px;'>&#10060;</span>
        <b>Less Intuitive:</b> Understanding the format of editing is not as intuitive in comparison to typical practice for editing through a form, which could create confusion.

      <p>
        <span style='font-size:20px; margin-right: 10px;'>&#10060;</span>
        <b>More Clicks:</b> Moving to edit small individual pieces of content such as links would require lots more clicks to move through and seperate screens, which would discourage users.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style='font-size:20px; margin-right: 10px;'>&#10060;</span>
        <b>Prioritizng a Clear User Flow:</b> Accessing and exiting editing mode might not be clear due to the similarity between the page as a viewer and editor. Furthermore, actions to take aren't clear.

      </div>
      <h4>
        Editing as a seperate form.
      </h4>
      <p>
        After rounds of iteration, I decided upon a seperate form with different sections for different pieces of content on the page broken down into 4 categories: Profile, Recruitment Banner, Description, and Events. To make a clear differentiation to viewing I used a complementary blue shade to distinguish editing actions.

          <em>Editing directly in the card</em>

          While this option reduced additional interactions on the screen, the entry point and interaction was not the most <b>intuitive</b> for users to understand. We instead tried familiar patterns employed in the Editing UX through a form.

          <h5>Takeaways</h5>
          <h3>Being immersed in a full team</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          This project was my first and longest experience in a full product team and extremely valuable for the same reason. Some of the lessons that have stuck with me the most from the experience include:
        </p>
        <h4>
          1. Documentation is super important.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Working with developers to implement features I created, as well as working with other designers, really emphasized the importance of good documentation for me. It made handoff and teamwork in general so much easier and allowed processes to flow much more smoothly.
        </p>
        <h4>
          2. When I'm feeling stuck, outside input is the best medicine.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Whenever I'd feel stuck in my designs, the best remedy was always outside input. When working on a design for so long its so easy to loose sight of easy and simple solutions as details get more convoluted, which is why outside help can sometimes be such a breath of fresh air. This experience taught me the importance of reaching out for help when I need it.

          As a relatively new designer when first joining the team, it took me a long time to find my voice and advocate for my designs. The other designers I learned from emphasized the importance of trusting myself and being confident!

          This was my first experience working on a full team with developers and product managers, which allowed me to gain a ton of experience I'm super thankful for. As this was my second ever product design project (and first ever from scratch!), I was really able to feel the amount of growth I went through during the process. However, especially having learned so much, there's definitely some things I would have done differently:
        </p>
        <p>
          <br><b>Prioritized accessibility guidelines:</b></br> A lot of my inital designs and designs for the Editing interface utilized lots of color and didn't adhere to accessibility guidelines due to lack of contrast. I would change the blue I used for the editing UI to something darker.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br><b>More Iteration:</b></br> I felt rushed to complete work to push towards a launch due to the huge volume of wireframing I completed and didn't try out different options that could have better addressed user goals.
        </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the semester we were finally preparing to launch our project was unilateraly shut down through decisions from higher ups due to the sudden development of a conflicting product, which prevented me from making further improvements. However, the experience and knowledge I gained was invaluable and has left me with only the best memories as I move to a new project.
