        <h3>Positively Impacting our Community</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="point">
        <h4>It is difficult to navigate the hundreds of clubs at Cornell.</h4>
        <p>
          There are lots of events and deadlines to tediously keep up with. Students will often miss information.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="point">
        <h4>Students often miss deadlines or find out too late for recruitment.</h4>
        <p>
          Particularly in Cornell's pre-professional culture, club recruitment and maintaining applications to student organizations is often stressful and demanding.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="point" style="margin-bottom: 5%">
        <h4>Some organizations need more visibility.</h4>
        <p>
          Many student organizations are unheard of due to the vast depth of different clubs on campus.

        <h5>User Groups</h5>
        <h3>Who can we help?</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        After acknowledging the common problem many students had at Cornell, we narrowed our target users into two distinctly defined user groups.
      </p>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 5%">
        <p>
          <b>Club Owners:</b> Students on the leadership team of a club who would use Clubview as a representative of their organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Club Seekers:</b> Students looking to browse through student organizations.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h5>The Product</h5>
        <h3>We decided to make something.</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
       To address the problems found, 
       <a href="https://www.cornelldti.org/" target="_blank">Design & Tech Initiative</a>,
       a Cornell project team, started the Clubview team aiming to improve the user experience of searching for and applying to clubs at Cornell by centralizing key club information into a common web platform.
      </p>
      <div>
        <h4>1. Students</h4>
        <p>
          Students can have an easier time club-searching using current information for a <b>smoother recruitment process</b>.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Clubs</h4>
        <p>
          Clubs can have a platform that is <b>easy</b> to update and can <b>increase visibility</b>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>Our team drafted an information hierarchy to combine the features we outlined as most important. We prioritized visibility of the home page which would show a large variety of different clubs to search from by making it our landing page. We also housed a majority of the features under the menu to make them intuitive and all listed in one place for ease of access.</p>

        <h3>Visualizing a Club</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        From low-fi sketches, I began to conecptualize how individual clubs would be shown on Clubview. 
      </p>
      <div class="imageblock">
        <img class="iteration" src="clubview/lowfi_cv.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>
        I decided to seperate between a left and right side to distribute different key components to the page. The <b>right side</b> allows users to scroll through larger pieces of content such as descriptions and images. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The static <b>left side</b> displays more vital information such as name, links, and other categories so that they won't move and will always be visible.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were many rounds of iterations to adjust both the visual branding and layout of the individual club page. Below are a few of the mockups that were developed during the iteration process. 
      </p>
      <div class="imageblock">
        <img class="iteration" style="width: 100%;" src="clubview/old_iterations.png">
      </div>
      <p>
        The individual clubpage went thorugh mid-fi and high-fi iterating to arrive at this final design. Important functions such as accessing links to various club resources or favoriting the club by clicking the heart were highlighted, and the design itself was centered around a pink palette as a bright color to draw attention and demonstrate the excitement of student organizations.
      </p>
      <div class="imageblock">
        <img class="iteration" style="width: 100%;" src="clubview/clubpage_final.png">
      </div>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
        My major considerations when designing centered on the prioritization of information. For example, links to club resources are signified through large buttons to draw attention to them and encourage interaction.

          <h5>Conclusion</h5>
          <h3>Being immersed in a full team</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          This project was my first and longest experience in a full product team and extremely valuable for the same reason. Some of the lessons that have stuck with me the most from the experience include:
        </p>
        <h4>
          1. Documentation is super important.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Working with developers to implement features I created, as well as working with other designers, really emphasized the importance of good documentation for me. It made handoff and teamwork in general so much easier and allowed processes to flow much more smoothly.
        </p>
        <h4>
          2. When I'm feeling stuck, outside input is the best medicine.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Whenever I'd feel stuck in my designs, the best rememdy was always outside input. When working on a design for so long its so easy to loose sight of easy and simple solutions as details get more convoluted, which is why outside help can sometimes be such a breath of fresh air. This experience taught me the importance of reaching out for help when I need it.
        </p>
        <h4>
          3. Trust yourself.
        </h4>
        <p>
          As a relatively new designer when first joining the team, it took me a long time to find my voice and advocate for my designs. The other designers I learned from emphasized the importance of trusting myself and being confident!
