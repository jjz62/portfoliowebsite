        <h3>Positively Impacting our Community</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="point">
        <h4>It is difficult to navigate the hundreds of clubs at Cornell.</h4>
        <p>
          There are lots of events and deadlines to tediously keep up with. Students will often miss information.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="point">
        <h4>Students often miss deadlines or find out too late for recruitment.</h4>
        <p>
          Particularly in Cornell's pre-professional culture, club recruitment and maintaining applications to student organizations is often stressful and demanding.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="point" style="margin-bottom: 5%">
        <h4>Some organizations need more visibility.</h4>
        <p>
          Many student organizations are unheard of due to the vast depth of different clubs on campus.

        <h5>User Groups</h5>
        <h3>Who can we help?</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        After acknowledging the common problem many students had at Cornell, we narrowed our target users into two distinctly defined user groups.
      </p>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 5%">
        <p>
          <b>Club Owners:</b> Students on the leadership team of a club who would use Clubview as a representative of their organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Club Seekers:</b> Students looking to browse through student organizations.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h5>The Product</h5>
        <h3>We decided to make something.</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
       To address the problems found, 
       <a href="https://www.cornelldti.org/" target="_blank">Design & Tech Initiative</a>,
       a Cornell project team, started the Clubview team aiming to improve the user experience of searching for and applying to clubs at Cornell by centralizing key club information into a common web platform.
      </p>
      <div>
        <h4>1. Students</h4>
        <p>
          Students can have an easier time club-searching using current information for a <b>smoother recruitment process</b>.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Clubs</h4>
        <p>
          Clubs can have a platform that is <b>easy</b> to update and can <b>increase visibility</b>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>Our team drafted an information hierarchy to combine the features we outlined as most important. We prioritized visibility of the home page which would show a large variety of different clubs to search from by making it our landing page. We also housed a majority of the features under the menu to make them intuitive and all listed in one place for ease of access.</p>

        <h3>Visualizing a Club</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        From low-fi sketches, I began to conecptualize how individual clubs would be shown on Clubview. 
      </p>
      <div class="imageblock">
        <img class="iteration" src="clubview/lowfi_cv.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>
        I decided to seperate between a left and right side to distribute different key components to the page. The <b>right side</b> allows users to scroll through larger pieces of content such as descriptions and images. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The static <b>left side</b> displays more vital information such as name, links, and other categories so that they won't move and will always be visible.
      </p>

          <h5>Conclusion</h5>
          <h3>My first case study.</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Instagram is a fun and enjoyable platform, but itâ€™s also scary at times. Topic Rooms are a fun and innovative approach to making Instagram a less intimidating and more meaningful place to interact with others. Next steps for Topic Rooms could be the creation and choice between Private and Public Topic Rooms to give the user even more of a chance for customizability.
          </p>
        <p>
          For a first time creating a case study, the experience was fun yet challenging. I was constantly reminded how little I truly knew as I explored different solution spaces and thought through the problem. The opportunity to immerse myself into the design cycle without pre-existing notions of a solution allowed me to tap into my creativity and problem-solving to create an organic solution!
