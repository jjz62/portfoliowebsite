        <h3>Positively Impacting our Community</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="point">
        <h4>It is difficult to navigate the hundreds of clubs at Cornell.</h4>
        <p>
          There are lots of events and deadlines to tediously keep up with. Students will often miss information.

      <div class="point">
        <h4>Students often miss deadlines or find out too late for recruitment.</h4>
        <p>
          Particularly in Cornell's pre-professional culture, club recruitment and maintaining applications to student organizations is often stressful and demanding.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="point" style="margin-bottom: 5%">
        <h4>Some organizations need more visibility.</h4>
        <p>
          Many student organizations are unheard of due to the vast depth of different clubs on campus.

        <h3>Who can we help?</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        After acknowledging the common problem many students had at Cornell, we narrowed our target users into two distinctly defined user groups.
      </p>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 5%">
        <p>
          <b>Club Owners:</b> Students on the leadership team of a club who would use Clubview as a representative of their organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Club Seekers:</b> Students looking to browse through student organizations.

        <h5>The Product</h5>
        <h3>We decided to make something.</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
       To address the problems found, 
       <a href="https://www.cornelldti.org/" target="_blank">Design & Tech Initiative</a>,
       a Cornell project team, started the Clubview team aiming to improve the user experience of searching for and applying to clubs at Cornell by centralizing key club information into a common web platform.
      </p>
      <div>
        <h4><span style='font-size:30px; margin-right: 10px;'>&#127891;</span> Students </h4>
        <p>
          Students can have an easier time club-searching using current information for a <b>smoother recruitment process</b>.
        </p>
        <h4><span style='font-size:30px; margin-right: 10px;'>&#128421;</span> Clubs</h4>
        <p>
          Clubs can have a platform that is <b>easy</b> to update and can <b>increase visibility</b>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>Our team drafted an information hierarchy to combine the features we outlined as most important. We prioritized visibility of the home page which would show a large variety of different clubs to search from by making it our landing page. We also housed a majority of the features under the menu to make them intuitive and all listed in one place for ease of access.</p>
      <div class="imageblock">
        <img style="width: 60%; margin-bottom: 5%; margin-top: 2%; justify-content: center;" src="clubview/cv_hierarchy.png">

    <div class="block">
      <div>
        <h5>Ideation</h5>
        <h3>Visualizing a Club</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        From low-fi sketches, I began to conecptualize how individual clubs would be shown on Clubview. 
      </p>
      <div class="imageblock">
        <img class="iteration" src="clubview/lowfi_cv.jpg">
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        <em>The low-fi layout chosen to iterate upon for its straightforward structuring of content which highlights elements of most importance such as name, links, and the favoriting clubs feature.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to seperate between a left and right side to distribute different key components to the page. The <b>right side</b> allows users to scroll through larger pieces of content such as descriptions and images. 
        The static <b>left side</b> displays more vital information such as name, links, and other categories so that they won't move and will always be visible.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were many rounds of iterations to adjust both the visual branding and layout of the individual club page. Below are a few of the mockups that were developed during the iteration process. 
      </p>
      <div class="imageblock">
        <img class="iteration" style="width: 100%;" src="clubview/old_iterations.png">
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        <em>Mid-fi iterations on the individual club page that were adjusted to reduce visual clutter and have a more modern interface.</em>
       </p>
      <p>
        The individual clubpage went thorugh mid-fi and high-fi iterating to arrive at this final design. Important functions such as accessing links to various club resources or favoriting the club by clicking the heart were highlighted, and the design itself was centered around a pink palette as a bright color to draw attention and demonstrate the excitement of student organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        While previous iterations applied a large variety of colors used frequently, in developing the current high-fi designs I focused on applying color to emphasize specific calls-to-action to create a less visually crowded page where important features are more visible.
      </p>
      <div class="imageblock">
        <img class="iteration" style="width: 100%;" src="clubview/clubpage_final.png">
      </div>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 8%; text-align: center;">
       <em>The finalized club pages apply the primary pink color minimally and features a gray backdrop with white cards to visually organize different information components in an easily digestible way.</em>

        <h3>Editing a Club</h3>
      </div>
      <h4>
        Editing was first conceptualized so that users could edit directly on the page.
      </h4>
      <div class="imageblock">
        <img class="iteration2" src="clubview/old_editing_flow.png">
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        <em>Users would change to Editing Mode and select specific cards to edit so that they could visualize the page as a whole.</em>
      </p>
      <h4>
        So, why change?
      </h4>
      <p>
        While the benefits of in-page editing included better visualization and a similar UI to match viewing a page, we ultimately came to the conclusion to change how club owners edit.
      </p>
      <div>
      <p>
        <span style='font-size:20px; margin-right: 10px;'>&#10060;</span>
        <b>Less Intuitive:</b> Understanding the format of editing is not as intuitive in comparison to typical practice for editing through a form, which could create confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style='font-size:20px; margin-right: 10px;'>&#10060;</span>
        <b>More Clicks:</b> Moving to edit small individual pieces of content such as links would require lots more clicks to move through and seperate screens, which would discourage users.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style='font-size:20px; margin-right: 10px;'>&#10060;</span>
        <b>Prioritizng a Clear User Flow:</b> Accessing and exiting editing mode might not be clear due to the similarity between the page as a viewer and editor. Furthermore, actions to take aren't clear.
      </p>
      </div>
      <h4>
        Editing as a seperate form.
      </h4>
      <p>
        After rounds of iteration, I decided upon a seperate form with different sections for different pieces of content on the page broken down into 4 categories: Profile, Recruitment Banner, Description, and Events. To make a clear differentiation to viewing I used a complementary blue shade to distinguish editing actions.
      </p>
      <div class="imageblock">

        <h5>Wireframing and Motion Design</h5>
        <h3>Preparing for Handoff</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        As ClubView was a completley new product, I spent a lot of time wireframing features and creating motion design for features in consultation with developers for feasibility.
      </p>
      <div class="imageblock">

        <em>Prior documentation of flows I prototyped for editing the Profile of the club page.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        To make implementation easier, I cleaned up documentation and wrote specific specifications for different features.
      </p>
      <div class="imageblock">
        <img class="iteration2" src="clubview/clean_wireframing.png">

          <h5>Conclusion</h5>
          <h3>Being immersed in a full team</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          This project was my first and longest experience in a full product team and extremely valuable for the same reason. Some of the lessons that have stuck with me the most from the experience include:
        </p>
        <h4>
          1. Documentation is super important.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Working with developers to implement features I created, as well as working with other designers, really emphasized the importance of good documentation for me. It made handoff and teamwork in general so much easier and allowed processes to flow much more smoothly.
        </p>
        <h4>
          2. When I'm feeling stuck, outside input is the best medicine.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Whenever I'd feel stuck in my designs, the best rememdy was always outside input. When working on a design for so long its so easy to loose sight of easy and simple solutions as details get more convoluted, which is why outside help can sometimes be such a breath of fresh air. This experience taught me the importance of reaching out for help when I need it.
        </p>
        <h4>
          3. Trust yourself.
        </h4>
        <p>
          As a relatively new designer when first joining the team, it took me a long time to find my voice and advocate for my designs. The other designers I learned from emphasized the importance of trusting myself and being confident!
