            <h3>What is CoachEra?</h3>
            <p>
              The summer before freshman year, I was excited to go to college but especially desperate to find a good roommate, a search that naturally fell to online platforms like Instagram. Yet, it felt terrifying to message random girls and strike up conversation. I checked my phone constantly, stressing over a reply, stressing over why I might not have received a reply, just stress.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I think about my personal problems with Instagram, I think about how difficult it can feel to complete Instagram’s fundamental action of interacting with others. In the same way that it can be difficult to interpret meaning behind a text, interpreting relationships through an online, textual lense is hard. I often second guess myself- should I have liked that persons post? Should I comment if we’re not that close, and even if I do, what do I say? The pressure to interact can feel suffocating. It’s even scarier to try and connect with those you don’t know or aren’t close. 
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 5%">
              I designed Topic Rooms, a live video and message chat room feature, to give users a space without pressure where they can interact organically and at a level of immersion they feel comfortable with, to form more meaningful connections.
