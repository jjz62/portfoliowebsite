      <div style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
      <p>
        <b>CoachEra</b> is a mobile app to assist users in achieving goals. A digital coach will guide you to make weekly plans and check in with you every day on your progress. Coaching focuses more on building a sustainable learning routine rather than optimizing your learning process. CoachEra is being utilized by the <a href="https://learning.cis.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Cornell Future of Learning Lab</a> to conduct research in classrooms.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our <b>user group</b> centers around those who have learning goals, particularly those who have primary jobs that often need to be prioritized in daily routines, like a full-time job, full-time childcare, full-time academic degree program (a.k.a. school). CoachEra gives them support to learn outside of simple daily obligation.
      </p>

      <p>Learn more about CoachEra at the official <a href="https://coachera.cs.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">website</a>. I was super thankful to flex my web development skills and create the site from scratch.</p>

      <div class="point">
        <h4>The Coach</h4>
        <p>
          The Coach's character needed to be conceptualized for various usage in the app. As the direct point of contact with users during messaging, the Coach needed to be friendly and personable, but also seem like a companion to a wide variety of diverse users.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="point">
        <h4>Branding</h4>
        <p>
          CoachEra needed a design system including a color scheme and logo.

        <h4>User Dashboard</h4>
        <p>
          The previous User Dashboard designs needed to be iterated upon and enhanced for better visualization and accessibility for users.

        <h3>The Coach</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        I went through various character designs of a coach that users could talk to like a companion and feel at ease with. While I originally conceptualized a human coach, our research team realized that utilizing a human coach with a distinct look could hold demographic traits that wouldn't make them feel as close should others not share those same traits.

      <p style="text-align: center;"><em>The original coach design showing different expressions.</em></p>

      <p>
        Instead of a human coach, we settled on anthropomorphic coaches, so I got to work and conceptualized the robot animals that are now implemented!

          <h6>The Initial Design</h6>
          <p>
            CoachEra was initially built based off pre-existing code and as such had not gone through a designer. Tasks were unclear due to a lack of formatting, and content such as 'Your Past Accomplishments' was not layed out in a visually digestible way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Viewing this existing design, I prioritized the emphasis of important content in the dashboard and visualizing information rather than relying on text. I wanted the Dashboard to be visually engaging as a resource users would find helpful in summarizing the data that had been collected from the app.
          </p>

        <div class="descriptor">
          <h6>Message Notification Iterations</h6>
          <p>
            I iterated considering a new color palette I'd created centered around teal.

          </p>
          <p>
            As the existing structure was already in place, iteration was mainly to improve the UI and visually update the Dashboard rather than interating through UX decisions. For example, below are iterations I made on notifying a user that the coach had sent them a message.

        <img class="iteration2" style="width: 70%;" src="coachera/menu_iterations.png">
        <p style="text-align: center;"><em>B was selected as the menu due to greater visibility and fewer click throughs to encourage use of multiple pages.</em></p>

          <h6>The Dashboard</h6>
          <p>
            Following the iteration process, I ended with the final iteration ready for implementation. One of the most major constraints I kept in mind when designing was the fact that I was also the one implementing the new changes through React. As such, I recognized my own coding limitations that translated into my designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            As my changes were mostly aesthetic, I focused on applying color in a way that was both visually engaging but indicative of interactions to help call attention to certain pieces of information.

          <h5>Conclusion</h5>
          <h3>Designer, Developer </h3>
        </div>

        <p>
          This opportunity focused more on my visual design skills through UI improvement and branding, but was also unique for my role both as a designer and developer that was both freeing and limiting. The opportunity really allowed me to understand the troubles developers may run into when implementing designs and the necessary adjustments that might need to happen, a lesson I'll definitely take into the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm excited to see the results that CoachEra can yield and am thankful to have worked under the mentorship of Ji-Yong Cho during this research opportunity.
