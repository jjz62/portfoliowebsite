      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The summer before freshman year, I was excited to go to college but especially desperate to find a good roommate, a search that naturally fell to online platforms like Instagram. Yet, it felt terrifying to message random girls and strike up conversation. I checked my phone constantly, stressing over a reply, stressing over why I might not have received a reply, just stress.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I think about my personal problems with Instagram, I think about how difficult it can feel to complete Instagram’s fundamental action of interacting with others. In the same way that it can be difficult to interpret meaning behind a text, interpreting relationships through an online, textual lense is hard. I often second guess myself- should I have liked that persons post? Should I comment if we’re not that close, and even if I do, what do I say? The pressure to interact can feel suffocating. It’s even scarier to try and connect with those you don’t know or aren’t close. 
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 5%">
        I designed Topic Rooms, a live video and message chat room feature, to give users a space without pressure where they can interact organically and at a level of immersion they feel comfortable with, to form more meaningful connections.

      <h3>User Research</h3>
      <p>
        I conducted user research with the goal of gleaning user pain points. I found multiple insights:
      </p>
      <div class="point">
        <h4>1. Users react to posts because they want people they are physically seperate from to know that they are still present.</h4>
        <p style="font-style:italic;">
          “Because right now I’m in college and not interacting with my friends from home as much... then I would interact with the photo as my way of showing my appreciation for our friendship.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="point">
        <h4>2. Users want to stay connected with others, but this is difficult because of the time it takes to stay in touch.</h4>
        <p style="font-style:italic;">
          “I check my Instagram feed almost every morning, and sometimes it can be really overwhelming and time-consuming to see the number of posts on my home feed.“
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="point" style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
        <h4>3. Users may not interact with posts of people they want to engage with because it’s time-consuming to think of what to say or do.</h4>
        <p style="font-style:italic;">
          “The physical action of liking, I tend to skip over, because it will take too much time.“
